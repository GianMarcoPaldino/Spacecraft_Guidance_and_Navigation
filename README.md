# Spacecraft_Guidance_and_Navigation
SGN Assignments. Politecnico di Milano, Academic Year 2021-2022.

1st Assignment - Guidance
- 1) Impulsive guidance: Simple shooting. Two-impulse Earth to Mars transfer optimization. 
- 2) Impulsive guidance: Multiple shooting. Three-impulse Earth to Earth-Moon L2 transfer optimization. 
- 3) Continuous guidance: Optimal Control Problem. Low thrust continuous guidance time-optimal transfer optimization for an Earth-centered orbit.

2nd Assignment - Navigation
- 1) Uncertainty propagation: Implementation of methods for uncertainty propagation of orbital motion (LinCov, Unscented Transform, Monte Carlo).
- 2) Batch filters: Least squares (minimum variance) solution to the navigation problem.
- 3) Sequential filters: Use of an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to update sequentially the spacecraft state by processing the measurements acquired by 
     a ground station network (real case study: ExoMars 2016/10/17 retargeting maneuver).
     
     
Use of NASA/NAIF SPICE Toolkit and SGP4.
